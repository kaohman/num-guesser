# Number Guesser

## Assignment
Mod 1 - Number Guesser Doubles

## Summary
This goal of this project is to build a game where a user can guess a number between 1 and 100 when they first arrive to the page. The user can then also add a custom number range to change the game contraints, reset the game back to a range of 1 to 100, and continue guessing until they guess matches the random number.
